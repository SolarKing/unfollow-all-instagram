# Unfollow All Instagram

This script was created to unfollow people on Instagram that in reality you didn't
actually follow.

Use at your descretion.

## Usage

1. Visit your instagram and navigate to your followings page. Url would looks something like this:

```
https://www.instagram.com/yourusername/following/
```

2. Scroll down the list to load multiple followings.

3. Paste the IIFE into the browser console and hit ENTER to run. This will _slowly_ go through the user flow of unfollowing on repeat. Leave this up and running for a while and it will stop once we hit the rate limit or you no longer have followings.
